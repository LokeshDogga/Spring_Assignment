---------Annotations in Spring----------

1. @Override
	=>  This annotation is used to indicate compiler that we are overriding a method 
		present in super class. it helps compiler to detect any type errors and ensures
		that we are overriding the right method.
2. @SuppressWarnings
	=> 	This annotation is used to indicate compiler to suppress warnings generated by
		that particular method, variable etc.. Here warnings that are suppressed are		
		superset of the warnings suppressed in all subset elements. for example if we 
		annotate a method with one warning and a variable present within it with another
		warning variable gets both the warnings suppressed.
3. @Service
	=>	This annotation indicates that the annotated class is a service. which is nothing
		but we will be having all our business logic in that service class.
4. @Repository
	=>	This annotation is used to indicate that our class is Repository. Here we write 
		all our DAO(Data Access Objects) and operations related to DataBases.
5. @Controller
	=> 	This annotation indicates that annotated class is controller. it helps  controller
		to detect classes through classpath scanning.
6. @Component
	=>	All the @Service, @Repository and @Controller are specializations of @Component.
		All classes annotated with @Component are considered as candidates. They are 	
		easily detected in classpath scanning.
7. @Autowired
	=>	This annotation is used for automatic dependency injection. Through this we can 
		reduce writing boilerplate code in bean configuration file.
8. @RequestMapping
	=> 	As the name itself tells us that it maps the web requests on to the specific handler
		classes. 
9. @Scope
	=> 	In spring we generally have components as singleton. In order to change this behaviour
		we use scope annotation
10.@PathVariable
	=>	we use this annotation in order to get the data from the url.
11.@RequestParam
	=>	we can bind the parameters to method variables using this annotation
12.@ModelAttribute
	=> 	This indicates that the argument must be retrieved from the model. if it is not present 
		the model it first added to the model and then populated with data from all the request
		parameters that have matching names.
13.@SessionAttributes
	=>	This annotation is used to declare session attributes.Here session attributes basically 
		store the model attributes.moreover we know sessions are used to state of websites.
14.@PreAuthorize
	=>	This is a Security Annotation. This is used to authorize the user and then give access
		to the functionality.
15.@Transactional
	=>	This annotation is used to tell that given method or class contains transactional methods
		ex:CRUD operations.
